SETTING UP LISP on Github Ubuntu Terminal.
Run the following commands in the terminal window. Every command should execute without errors, before entering the 
next command. When all 4 are executed, you will be able to run lisp using the command "sbcl". 
   
   curl -L http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sbcl/sbcl-1.4.3-x86-linux-binary.tar.bz2 --out out.tar.bz2
   
   bzip2 -cd out.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -

   cd sbcl-1.4.3-x86-linux/

   sudo ./install.sh


Using the videos for the Week 3 lectures in D2L, write the Lisp code for the following algorithms:
1. Sequential Search. The inputs to this funtion will be a list and a target item. The function should return the position of 
of the target item in the list, or return -1 if the item is not found.
2. Bubblesort. The input to this function is an unsorted list of numbers. The function returns the list with the 
numbers arranged in non-decreasing order.

Upload/create separate .lisp files for both assignments. In both files all functions should be explained with detailed comments
